The tools here are designed to help you download data from IRIS and then prepare the downloaded data for FuncLab

Everything you need should be here, aside from a couple PERL libraries needed for FetchEvent and FetchData.
First, compile codes mseed2sac
  cd mseed2sac-2.0
  make
  cp mseed2sac ~/bin 
  cd ../
where ~/bin is some directory on your search path
and then compile c utilities
  cd c_utils
  make
  cd ../

Then edit request_data.tcsh for your desired region, incident phase, minimum magnitude, distance window, etc...
You may also wish to adjust the FetchData call. Particularily the -F, -M, and -O commands are useful for gathering data from multiple datacenters (where -M replaces -m and -O replaces -o)

Run request_data.tcsh and wait while it downloads data.

Once the data is downloaded, use prep_data_for_funclab.tcsh
This requires sac and saclst utilities. They are available from IRIS.
There shouldn't be much need to adjust things, but turn off the system beep if you can and you may wish to adjust the output dt variable at the top
