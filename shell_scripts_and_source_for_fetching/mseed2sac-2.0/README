mseed2sac - Convert Mini-SEED waveform data to SAC

-- Building/Installing --

In most Unix environments a simple 'make' will build the program.

If your system does not have zlib you can compile the program without
support for ZIP archive output: first type 'make' in the main
directory (the build will fail), then go to the 'src' directory and
type 'make nozip'.

In the Win32 environment the Makefile.wat can be used with Open
Watcom's wmake program.  The Win32 Makefiles are configured to build
without zlib support, and therefore no ZIP archive output.

For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.
